Remember:
1. Your response must be ONLY the JSON object
2. Do not include any text before or after the JSON
3. Use proper JSON formatting with double quotes
4. All lists must contain at least one item
5. All fields must be present
6. Use the provided metrics to inform your analysis
7. Do not include any markdown formatting or code blocks
8. The response should be a single, valid JSON object
9. Do not include any explanatory text or comments
10. Ensure all JSON keys and string values are enclosed in double quotes

Example of a valid response:
